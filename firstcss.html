        "Nature thought in English" <span style="color:blue">refers to common English expressions 
        and</span> philosophical ideas about the natural world, often found in quotes and proverbs. 
        These expressions emphasize nature's role as a teacher, a source of healing and peace, and a place of wildness and freedom,
         as seen in famous sayings like "Let nature be your teacher" (Wordsworth) or
         "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished"
